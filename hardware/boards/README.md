# Boards

There are files for three boards here.  Do not be dismayed.  The only one that matters, electronically, is the "mainboard".  This is the AirTalk itself.  The other two boards are just to make a cheapo case.  More details on that below.

The main board has been fabbed successfully at JLCPCB.  I haven't tried other fabs.


# The "Case"

The top and bottom PCBs are if you want to make a "case" for it out of two other PCBs. I found this approach gave a really nice result for very little money.  Here's how I did this.

For each AirTalk, you will need:

* 4 x M3x15mm nylon standoffs (the kind with the internal thread that can take screws in both ends, not with the screw thread sticking out the bottom)
* 4 x M3x5mm nylon standoffs
* 4 x M3x15mm (or M3x12mm) nylon screws
* 4 x M3x5mm nylon screws

I found that either black hex standoffs + black screws or clear standoffs + clear screws looked best.

To assemble:

1. Take the bottom board.  For each of the four screw holes, put a 15mm screw through the hole from the bottom, then put the 5mm standoff onto the screw.  Screw it right down until the standoff touches the bottom board.  About 10mm of screw thread should be left sticking out the top of the standoff.
2. Put the mainboard onto the bottom board with the four screw threads through the four holes in the mainboard.
3. For each of the screw threads, tighten the 15mm standoff onto the bits of screw thread that are visible.  This will fix the mainboard down.
4. Line the four screw holes in the top PCB up with the four 15mm standoffs.  Fix the top board down with the four 5mm screws.
